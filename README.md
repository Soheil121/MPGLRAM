# MPGLRAM
GLRAM based on multiple transformation pairs

1. Load the data
2. Initialize the parameters
3. Reshape the data into n cells where each cell indicates a sample
4. Defining parameters which are used in our proposed method.
5. The first step of the algorithm done to find the initial value of the parameters.
6. Call the MPGLRAM__ function with the initialized value gained the previous step
   to find optimal transformation pairs and reduced data.
7. Uncomment ERROR function to calculate the Root mean square relative errors (RMSRE). 
8. Uncomment PSNR function to calculate the peak signal-to-noise ratio.
